# Internal Benchmarking

Benchkit now uses an internal benchmarking system that replaces the previous Hyperfine dependency.

## Features

- Precise timing using Rust's `std::time::Instant`
- Support for parameter substitution matrices
- Lifecycle hooks for setup, prepare, conclude, and cleanup stages
- CPU affinity control using hwloc for consistent benchmarking
- Statistical analysis of benchmark results
- JSON results export
- Backward compatibility with existing configuration files

## Configuration

The benchmark configuration format is mostly compatible with the previous format. However, there are some changes to accommodate the new internal benchmarking system:

```yaml
global:
  # Global benchmark option defaults
  benchmark:
    warmup: 1
    runs: 5
    capture_output: false
    
  # CPU affinity control
  benchmark_cores: "1-7"    # Cores to run benchmark commands on
  runner_cores: "0"         # Core to bind the main benchkit process to

  # Other global options remain the same
  source: $HOME/src/core/bitcoin
  scratch: $HOME/.local/state/benchkit/scratch
  commits: ["746ab19d5a13c98ae7492f9b6fb7bd6a2103c65d"]
  tmp_data_dir: /tmp/benchkit
  host: x86_64-linux-gnu

benchmarks:
  - name: "assumeutxo signet test sync"
    network: signet
    connect: 127.0.0.1:39333
    
    # Benchmark-specific options (overrides global options)
    benchmark:
      command: "bitcoind -dbcache={dbcache} -stopatheight=160001"
      warmup: 0
      runs: 1
      
      # Parameter lists for substitution
      parameter_lists:
        - var: dbcache
          values: ["450", "32000"]
```

### Benchmark Options

- `warmup`: Number of warmup runs to perform (not included in results)
- `runs`: Number of measured runs to perform
- `capture_output`: Whether to capture and store command output
- `command`: The command template to execute (with parameter placeholders)
- `parameter_lists`: Lists of parameters to substitute in the command

### CPU Affinity Options

- `benchmark_cores`: CPU cores to run benchmark commands on (e.g., "1-7", "0,2,4-6")
- `runner_cores`: CPU core(s) to bind the main benchkit process to (e.g., "0")

This CPU affinity control replaces the previous `wrapper` command approach, providing a more integrated solution using process groups and the hwloc library. The implementation:

1. Binds the main benchkit process to `runner_cores` at startup
2. For each benchmark command:
   - Creates a new process group using `process_group(0)` on the Command
   - Spawns the command in this new process group
   - Binds the process ID to the specified cores
   - Binds the entire process group to the same cores (-pid in Linux)
   - Waits for completion

This approach ensures that all child processes spawned by the benchmark command inherit the CPU affinity constraints, which is crucial for multi-process applications like Bitcoin Core. The use of process groups provides better isolation and ensures that any child processes spawned dynamically during the benchmark's execution will also be constrained to the correct CPU cores.

The main benefits include:
1. Direct process group binding using Linux's scheduling APIs
2. No external tools needed (e.g., taskset or hwloc-bind)
3. Consistent CPU affinity for main processes and all their child processes
4. Better control over system resources during benchmarking
5. Process isolation through dedicated process groups
6. Support for complex CPU core specifications

## Lifecycle Scripts

The benchmark system executes lifecycle scripts at different stages:

1. **Setup**: Run once before all benchmark runs
2. **Prepare**: Run before each benchmark run
3. **Conclude**: Run after each benchmark run
4. **Cleanup**: Run once after all benchmark runs

These scripts now receive named arguments instead of positional arguments:

```
--binary=/path/to/binary
--connect=127.0.0.1:8333
--network=signet
--out-dir=/path/to/output
--snapshot=/path/to/snapshot
--datadir=/path/to/data
--iteration=0
--commit=abcdef
```

This makes the scripts more maintainable and self-documenting.

## Parameter Substitution

The parameter substitution system allows you to run benchmarks with different combinations of parameters. For example:

```yaml
command: "bitcoind -dbcache={dbcache} -stopatheight={height}"
parameter_lists:
  - var: dbcache
    values: ["450", "32000"]
  - var: height
    values: ["100000", "200000"]
```

This will run the benchmark with all combinations of `dbcache` and `height` values.

## Results

Benchmark results are exported in JSON format, containing:
- Command executed
- Parameters used
- Results from each run (time, exit code, etc.)
- Statistical summary (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
- Master summary with relative speed comparisons (when running multiple parameter combinations)

### Master Summary

When running benchmarks with multiple parameter combinations, a master summary section is included in the results. This summary provides:

- The fastest benchmark configuration identified
- Relative speed comparisons between each configuration and the fastest one
- Error margins for the comparisons

This is similar to how Hyperfine displays results like:

```
Summary
  bitcoind -dbcache=32000 ran
    1.75 Â± 0.08 times faster than bitcoind -dbcache=450
```

The master summary helps quickly identify which configuration performed best and by what margin.

This format is compatible with existing visualization tools.
